              <h4> ACCEPTABLE GROUNDS FOR ISSUING A REFUND </h4>
              <p>You are eligible for a refund:-

              If you did not download any commercial component from our site, you did not request support and requested your refund within 14 days of the date your invoice was issued.
              The product you subscribed to is discontinued within 14 days of the date of your subscription, no matter if you have downloaded the software or asked for support. Exception: this does not apply to us dropping support for a particular version of Joomla!, PHP or any other server-side or client-side software. Excepted cases are not eligible for refund.
              Stolen credit card, PayPal account or other form of payment or financial instrument used to pay for the subscription. In this case we kindly request that you ask for a refund instead of filing a chargeback request with PayPal or your bank.
              It is impossible for us to test our software on every server platform and every server configuration it may encounter. Therefore, if our support staff is unable to get our software up and running on your server within the first 14 days after purchase, we will happily give you a refund. You will need to provide us with full access to your hosting / server environments in order for us to fully debug and install the software. If you cannot provide us this access in a timely and cooperative manner, then we will not be able to give you a refund.

          All requests for refund MUST be initiated through our Contact Us page within the refund period.</p>

              <p>To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use "cookies", or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the
                user's individual interests using the Identified Computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The
                only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply (an example of this is when you ask for our Personalised Horoscope). A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own
                cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not control.<br>
                Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet
                know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users,
                to measure traffic within our site and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come. </p>

                the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access<br>
                However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time to incorporate necessary future changes. Of course, our use of any information we gather will always be consistent with the policy
                under which the information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be.</p>
